        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-oswald u-large-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2"> Wearable devices have progressed significantly in the integration with humans, particularly in rehabilitation and augmentation. This requires an interdisciplinary approach and integration of knowledge from fields such as robotics, human-factors, soft electronics, biomechanics, and neuroscience. The workplace is a promising area for device integration, but personalizing wearable robot control parameters is a challenge. A potential solution is a personalized lower-limb wearable robot that senses a user’s physical effort using soft-wearable electronics. Another example is the use of wearable sensors to improve AR devices. To address these challenges and opportunities, a workshop has been planned to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines related to human-device symbiosis. The workshop aims to present the state of the art, identify open problems, and foster collaboration through invited talks, poster presentations, and panel discussions. Emphasis will be placed on encouraging participation from students and researchers from underrepresented groups.</p>

              <br> The drive to discover effective strategies for human movement assistance has led to investigations into human-wearable robots. My work strives to advance this field by concentrating on wearable robots that adapt to individual users, enabling a smart assistance strategy tailored to human wearers. In this presentation, I will discuss a robot adaptation method for user-centricity, human-in-the-loop (HIL) optimization, and a user coaching technique designed to prevent unfavorable movements. Utilizing a machine learning approach with biofeedback, the HIL optimization substantially reduces walking and squatting efforts for users wearing various wearable robots. Additionally, my research investigates how users can adjust their movement patterns to optimize the advantages of personalized robots. The talk will conclude with an exploration of the challenges and opportunities posed by the HIL assistance controller in promoting positive user movements.<br>

At present, she works on developing assistance methods to enhance balance and walking economy using wearable devices (e.g., exoskeletons and prostheses). As a part of this effort, she is also interested in using those devices to understand further an impaired gait and advance training methods of motor function.

              <br> This talk introduces a new bioelectronic system integrating mixed-reality (MR) environments through a soft biosensing glove. This innovative system uses nanomanufacturing techniques to incorporate flexible sensors, wireless circuits, and stretchable interconnectors into the wearable glove. The glove includes an integrated capacitive pressure sensor at the fingertips, allowing it to accurately measure physical interactions with virtual objects. This technology can measure various virtual object parameters, including mass, movement latency, dynamic friction coefficient, angular drag coefficient, and linear drag coefficient. Experimental results with human subjects have shown a positive correlation between pinching force and dynamic friction coefficient, and mass physics parameters, indicating that this wearable biosensing glove system has the potential to transform the way we interact with and design MR environments. This makes it a powerful tool for rehabilitation applications and MR human-machine interfaces.<br>

              <br>In this talk, Dr. Yeo will share the basic scientific study of integrated soft sensors and electronics in both wearable and implantable configurations. He will talk about the limitations of the existing biomedical systems used in continuous health monitoring and disease diagnosis. A set of new solutions that can tackle these issues will be shared with the details. Specifically, he will discuss unique strategies for designing and fabricating new systems using soft and hybrid materials. In terms of recent outcomes, he will introduce a few projects that develop soft electronic sensors and platforms targeting sleep disorders, pediatric electrolyte monitoring, and eye movement-based human-machine interfaces. In vitro and in vivo study examples will capture the novelty of these soft electronic systems and their major advantages over the existing systems in real-time continuous health monitoring, portable healthcare, quantitative disease diagnosis, and connected therapeutics with human-machine interfaces.<br>

              <span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Recently, there has been a surge of interest in wearable robotic systems as a viable solution for restoring diminished or lost human physical capabilities. These wearable robotic devices are characterized by integrating diverse, pre-existing robotic technologies focusing on human-centric applications. Consequently, many research endeavors are being undertaken, grounded in human movement and biomechanics principles. Human biomechanics plays a pivotal role in various aspects of wearable robotic systems, encompassing conceptual sketches, performance optimization, design engineering, analysis of assistive effects, and empirical validation. In this presentation, the speaker will expound upon many research projects they have spearheaded within this domain while also elucidating the salient aspects of human biomechanics employed in studying wearable robotic systems.</span>
