        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-oswald u-large-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-2"> Wearable devices have progressed significantly in the integration with humans, particularly in rehabilitation and augmentation. This requires an interdisciplinary approach and integration of knowledge from fields such as robotics, human-factors, soft electronics, biomechanics, and neuroscience. The workplace is a promising area for device integration, but personalizing wearable robot control parameters is a challenge. A potential solution is a personalized lower-limb wearable robot that senses a user’s physical effort using soft-wearable electronics. Another example is the use of wearable sensors to improve AR devices. To address these challenges and opportunities, a workshop has been planned to bring together researchers from diverse disciplines related to human-device symbiosis. The workshop aims to present the state of the art, identify open problems, and foster collaboration through invited talks, poster presentations, and panel discussions. Emphasis will be placed on encouraging participation from students and researchers from underrepresented groups.</p>

        <p class="u-align-justify u-custom-font u-font-oswald u-large-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-4"> Our full-day, in-person workshop will involve seminar talks, panel discussions, and a poster session, with ample coffee and networking breaks. All sessions will be live-streamed via video call to enable access for participants joining the conference remotely (except for the poster session). Below is the detailed information about each session. We’ve structured the proposed sessions to be specifically oriented to include both junior and senior researchers/engineers to organically engage and network amongst each other.</p>

She received her Ph.D. degree from Carnegie Mellon University and held a post-doctoral appointment at Harvard University. She was a control engineer in humanoid robotics at Samsung. Dr. Kim’s primary focus is the development of assistive robotic devices for improving mobility and quality of life through integrative approaches of numerical dynamic models, machine learning techniques, experimental testbeds, and controlled human-subject experiments. At present, she works on developing assistance methods to enhance balance and walking economy using wearable devices (e.g., exoskeletons and prostheses). As a part of this effort, she is also interested in using those devices to understand further an impaired gait and advance training methods of motor function. In line with this research, Dr. Kim also explores the control of autonomous devices (e.g., legged robots).</p>

This innovative system uses nanomanufacturing techniques to incorporate flexible sensors, wireless circuits, and stretchable interconnectors into the wearable glove. The glove includes an integrated capacitive pressure sensor at the fingertips, allowing it to accurately measure physical interactions with virtual objects. This technology can measure various virtual object parameters, including mass, movement latency, dynamic friction coefficient, angular drag coefficient, and linear drag coefficient. Experimental results with human subjects have shown a positive correlation between pinching force and dynamic friction coefficient, and mass physics parameters, indicating that this wearable biosensing glove system has the potential to transform the way we interact with and design MR environments. This makes it a powerful tool for rehabilitation applications and MR human-machine interfaces.<br>

He will talk about the limitations of the existing biomedical systems used in continuous health monitoring and disease diagnosis. A set of new solutions that can tackle these issues will be shared with the details. Specifically, he will discuss unique strategies for designing and fabricating new systems using soft and hybrid materials. In terms of recent outcomes, he will introduce a few projects that develop soft electronic sensors and platforms targeting sleep disorders, pediatric electrolyte monitoring, and eye movement-based human-machine interfaces. In vitro and in vivo study examples will capture the novelty of these soft electronic systems and their major advantages over the existing systems in real-time continuous health monitoring, portable healthcare, quantitative disease diagnosis, and connected therapeutics with human-machine interfaces.<br>
